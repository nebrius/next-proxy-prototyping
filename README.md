# next-proxy-prototyping

Had a hare-brained idea, wanted to play around. You probably shouldn't look at this.

After cloning, run `npm i` in `/`, `/proxy`, and `/next`.

Run `npm start` in the `proxy` folder, and simultaneously run `npm dev` in the `next` folder. Then visit http://localhost:3000/characters/fry in your browser and navigate around.
